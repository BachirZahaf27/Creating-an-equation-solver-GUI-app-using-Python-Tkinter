# Creating-an-equation-solver-GUI-app-using-Python-Tkinter

# This python application solve linear equation using python as a coding language and Tkinter as an interface maker
1) Making the interface:
To make the interface we need PAGE app "https://sajeewasp.com/page-installation/", then with it we can make an interface like this image below:

With the attribute name like the 2nd image below:

2) Adding the the finctionallity:
After saving the interface and generating the python file we can add the functionallity to the interface, you can see the code here:

3) Binding the functions with  corresponding Button click events:
After making the functions we can bind the button with this functions like showing below:

# My problem:
my problem is when i bind the button with the function and run the program ,the window doesn't open and it showing me this error on the console:
